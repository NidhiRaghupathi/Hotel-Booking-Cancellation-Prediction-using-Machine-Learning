Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations based on various features associated with the booking. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can optimize their operations, minimize revenue loss, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Key Features:

Data Exploration:

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics and distributions of the features in the dataset.
Visualized trends, correlations, and patterns in the data to gain insights into factors influencing booking cancellations.

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like label encoding

Feature Engineering:

Extracted meaningful features from the dataset that might influence booking cancellations.

Model Selection:

Applied various machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, considering factors like performance, interpretability, and scalability.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained the selected models using the training dataset.
Evaluated the trained models using metrics such as accuracy.

Insights:

From above HeatMap we can see that the above data is not correlated.
More people prefer City Hotel
Repeated guests have min.cancelled bookings
City Hotel has maximum cancelled bookings
City Hotel has higher prices. August which was the crowdest month
2016 is the year with maximum bookings and City Hotel has max bookings
From above analysis we can see that Random Forest Model is giving highest score of 0.99 i.e 99%.
